I am a [LiDO](https://www.lido-dtp.ac.uk/) PhD student at the [Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology (ISMB)](http://www.ismb.lon.ac.uk/) based in [Dr. Adrian Shepherd](http://shepherd-group.ismb.lon.ac.uk/)'s group. My research involves working on systems understanding of the adaptive immune repertoires by using immunogenomics and machine learning approaches.
